# üîß Fix Row Level Security (RLS) Issue

## Problem
Profile updates are failing with this error:
```
new row violates row-level security policy for table "user_profiles"
```

## Root Cause
Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on the `user_profiles` table but no proper policies are configured, blocking all insert/update operations.

---

## üöÄ QUICK FIX (Recommended for Development)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New query"

### Step 2: Run This SQL Command
```sql
-- Disable RLS for user_profiles table
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON user_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE user_profiles_id_seq TO authenticated;

-- Verify the fix
SELECT 'RLS disabled successfully!' as status;
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Go back to your app
2. Try updating your profile
3. It should work now!

## üîí PROPER FIX (Recommended for Production)

If you want to keep RLS enabled with proper security policies:

### Step 1: Enable RLS with Policies
```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow users to view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid()::text = uid);

-- Allow users to insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON user_profiles
    FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = uid);

-- Allow users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles
    FOR UPDATE 
    USING (auth.uid()::text = uid)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = uid);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON user_profiles TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE user_profiles_id_seq TO authenticated;
```

## üß™ Test Your Fix

### Option 1: Browser Console Test
1. Open your app in browser
2. Press F12 to open console
3. Copy and paste the `QUICK_RLS_FIX.js` script
4. Run it to test if RLS is working

### Option 2: Manual Test
1. Try updating your profile in the app
2. Check browser console for errors
3. If successful, you'll see success messages

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Quick Fix Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Table Exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles';
   ```

2. **Check Current RLS Status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles';
   ```

3. **Check Permissions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
   WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles';
   ```

### If You Still Get Errors:

1. **Run the full diagnostic script:** `DIAGNOSE_PROFILE_UPDATE_ISSUE.sql`
2. **Create the table if missing:** `CREATE_USER_PROFILES_TABLE.sql`
3. **Check your Supabase API keys** in your app configuration
4. **Verify user authentication** is working properly

## üìã What Each Fix Does

### Quick Fix (Disable RLS):
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Immediate fix, works for all users
- ‚ùå **Cons:** Less secure, anyone can access any record
- üéØ **Best for:** Development, testing, quick fixes

### Proper Fix (RLS Policies):
- ‚úÖ **Pros:** Secure, users can only access their own data
- ‚ùå **Cons:** More complex, requires proper authentication
- üéØ **Best for:** Production, secure applications

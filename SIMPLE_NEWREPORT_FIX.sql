-- =====================================================
-- SIMPLE FIX FOR NEWREPORT FORM ACCESS ISSUE
-- =====================================================

-- This is a simplified version that avoids column name case sensitivity issues

-- =====================================================
-- 1. CHECK IF NEWREPORT FORM EXISTS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    'üîç Checking if newreport form exists...' as step,
    COUNT(*) as form_count
FROM page_configurations 
WHERE id = 'newreport';

-- Show current configuration if it exists
SELECT 
    'üìã Current newreport configuration:' as info,
    id,
    title,
    selected_offices,
    CASE 
        WHEN selected_offices IS NULL THEN 'NULL - should allow all users'
        WHEN jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) = 0 THEN 'EMPTY - allows all users'
        ELSE 'HAS RESTRICTIONS: ' || selected_offices::text
    END as access_level
FROM page_configurations 
WHERE id = 'newreport';

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX THE NEWREPORT FORM (MAIN FIX)
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üîß Applying fix for newreport form...' as step;

-- Create or update newreport form to allow all users
INSERT INTO page_configurations (
    id,
    title,
    selected_offices
) VALUES (
    'newreport',
    'New Report',
    '[]'::jsonb -- Empty array = no office restrictions = allow all users
) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
    selected_offices = '[]'::jsonb,
    title = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.title, page_configurations.title);

SELECT '‚úÖ newreport form has been configured to allow all users' as result;

-- =====================================================
-- 3. VERIFY THE FIX
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üîç Verifying the fix...' as step;

-- Check the updated configuration
SELECT
    '‚úÖ Updated newreport configuration:' as info,
    id,
    title,
    selected_offices,
    CASE
        WHEN selected_offices IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) = 0
        THEN '‚úÖ ACCESSIBLE TO ALL USERS'
        ELSE 'üîí RESTRICTED TO: ' || selected_offices::text
    END as access_level
FROM page_configurations
WHERE id = 'newreport';

-- =====================================================
-- 4. CLEAN UP OTHER FORMS (OPTIONAL)
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üßπ Cleaning up other forms with null office targeting...' as step;

-- Fix any other forms with null office targeting
UPDATE page_configurations 
SET selected_offices = '[]'::jsonb
WHERE selected_offices IS NULL;

-- Show how many forms were fixed
SELECT 
    '‚úÖ Forms fixed:' as info,
    COUNT(*) as fixed_count
FROM page_configurations 
WHERE selected_offices = '[]'::jsonb;

-- =====================================================
-- 5. SHOW ALL FORMS STATUS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üìä All forms access status:' as summary;

-- Show summary of all forms and their access levels
SELECT 
    id as form_id,
    title,
    CASE 
        WHEN selected_offices IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) = 0 
        THEN 'üåç ALL USERS'
        ELSE 'üîí RESTRICTED (' || jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) || ' offices)'
    END as access_level
FROM page_configurations 
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN selected_offices IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE 1
    END,
    id;

-- =====================================================
-- 6. TEST SPECIFIC OFFICE ACCESS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üß™ TESTING OFFICE ACCESS FOR: Ondipudur SO' as test_section;

            RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Form "%" - ACCESS GRANTED (no office restrictions)', form_record.id;

                CASE WHEN has_access THEN 'GRANTED' ELSE 'DENIED' END,
                form_record.selected_offices;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;

    RAISE NOTICE '';

    FOR form_record IN
        SELECT id, title, selected_offices

-- =====================================================
-- TROUBLESHOOTING
-- =====================================================

/*
IF THE FIX DOESN'T WORK:

1. Check if the form ID is exactly "newreport":
   - Verify in your Flutter app code
   - Check the exact string being passed to FormFilteringService

2. Restart your Flutter app:
   - Clear app cache
   - Hot restart may not be enough

3. Check user office name:
   - Make sure user has an office assigned
   - Check user_profiles table for the current user

4. Check console logs:
   - Look for detailed debug output from FormFilteringService
   - Should show "Form has no office restrictions, allowing access"

5. If still having issues:
   - Run: SELECT * FROM page_configurations WHERE id = 'newreport';
   - Should show selected_offices as empty array: []

EMERGENCY FIX (if nothing else works):
UPDATE page_configurations SET selected_offices = '[]'::jsonb;
-- This makes ALL forms accessible to ALL users

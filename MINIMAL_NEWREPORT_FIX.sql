-- MINIMAL FIX FOR NEWREPORT FORM ACCESS ISSUE
-- =====================================================

-- This version only uses columns that definitely exist

-- =====================================================
-- 1. CHECK CURRENT STATE
-- =====================================================

    'üìã Current newreport form:' as info,

-- =====================================================
-- 2. FIX THE NEWREPORT FORM
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 3. VERIFY THE FIX
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üîç Step 3: Verifying the fix...' as step;

-- Check the updated configuration
SELECT

-- =====================================================
-- 4. TEST FOR "Ondipudur SO" OFFICE
-- =====================================================

-- Test 2: Check if "Ondipudur SO" is targeted by any forms
SELECT 
    'üîç Forms targeting "Ondipudur SO":' as test,

    id,
    title,
    selected_offices

-- =====================================================
-- 5. SHOW ALL FORMS ACCESS STATUS
-- =====================================================

-- Show access status for all forms
SELECT 
    id as form_id,

        WHEN selected_offices ? 'Ondipudur SO' THEN 1
        ELSE 2
    END,

-- =====================================================
-- 6. OFFICE ANALYSIS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üìä Step 6: Office targeting analysis...' as step;

-- Count forms with no restrictions vs restricted forms
SELECT 
    'üìà Forms summary:' as summary,
    SUM(CASE WHEN selected_offices IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as unrestricted_forms,

-- Show all offices mentioned in targeting (if any)
SELECT 
    'üè¢ Offices mentioned in form targeting:' as info,

    COUNT(*) as forms_count
FROM page_configurations,

WHERE selected_offices IS NOT NULL 
  AND jsonb_array_length(selected_offices) > 0
GROUP BY office_name
ORDER BY forms_count DESC, office_name;

-- =====================================================
-- 7. FINAL VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üéØ Step 7: Final verification...' as step;

-- Final check: Is "Ondipudur SO" mentioned in any form targeting?
SELECT 
    'üîç Is "Ondipudur SO" in any targeting list?' as question,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXISTS (

            WHERE office_name = 'Ondipudur SO'
        )
        THEN '‚úÖ YES - Found in targeting lists'
        ELSE '‚ùå NO - Not in any targeting lists (forms allow all users)'
    END as answer;

-- =====================================================
-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üéâ ANALYSIS COMPLETE!' as status;

SELECT 
    'Key findings:' as findings,

-- NEXT STEPS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 'üìã NEXT STEPS:' as next_steps;

SELECT '1. Restart your Flutter app' as step_1;
SELECT '2. Try accessing newreport form' as step_2;

-- TROUBLESHOOTING
-- =====================================================

/*
TROUBLESHOOTING:

If newreport still doesn't work after this fix:

1. Check the form ID in your Flutter app:
   - Make sure it's exactly "newreport" (case-sensitive)
   - Check FormFilteringService.canUserAccessForm() call

2. Check user office name:
   - Should be "Ondipudur SO" 
   - Verify in user_profiles table

3. Check console logs:
   - Should show: "Form has no office restrictions, allowing access"
   - If not, there might be a caching issue

4. Clear app cache:
   - Hot restart might not be enough
   - Try full app restart

5. Emergency fix (if nothing works):
   UPDATE page_configurations SET selected_offices = '[]'::jsonb;
   -- This makes ALL forms accessible to ALL users
